# Harvester-Adventure

The Harvester of Souls Adventure

This is an adventure from Crossroads Games, originally written for the Eldritch RPG by Eric Bergeron. It has been converted to 5E 
and turned into a module for Encounter+. I finished the module in Encounter+ and didn't realize I couldn't export back out into a format allowing editing in Studio Code, so the markdown files in the repository are being redone right now. Ironically, the .module file is the most recent version.
