# Harvester’s Lair

## 1: Cave Entrance

**Read:**

> You approach a cave as indicated by your map. The wide entrance set in a rocky overgrown hillside looks deep and dark without any sign of life. Before the entrance, on each side of a lone boulder, dance two trees by the wind’s music; that’s the only sound you can hear. Indeed, the area is eerily quiet. {.read}

![Cave Entrance](CaveEntrance.jpg =500x){.print-center}

As the party gets near the entrance they can smell rot and will notice black flies flying and buzzing all over the place.

## 2: Old Bandit Quarters

**Read:**

> The wide cave here is big, between 50 and 80 feet in certain sections, featuring many exits and ceilings as high as 20 feet. The floor is speckled with fresh blood, attracting swarms of flies. The place looks like some people lived here. There is crude furniture around, such as a round wooden table, some wooden stools, and some wooden shelves hanging on uneven walls. On one of the shelves sits a small chest and some fur. Many ceramic or steel bowls, pots and utensils sit on makeshift wooden tables. Some crates are found deeper north along with a bag and a chest. On the far east side, there seems to be a camp fire still burning. To the west side, near two exits can be found a bedroll made of brown fur. {.read}

The gore covering the walls emits an unbearable stench of death. Two Soul Seeker Monsters reside here, and if the party isn’t quiet, they immediately charge at them, flailing and contorting their bodies in a macabre way. The soul seekers only wear rags or nothing at all.

If the party can search and loot the area, pretty much everything is rotten or broken, and the only thing of interest are two chests; one on the northern shelf, and the bigger chest on the ground between crates farther north. The small unlocked chest contains 7 simple copper rings worth approximately 10 gold each. A blue gemstone worth approximately 35 gold can be found in a fake bottom. A larger chest can trigger a [poison needle trap](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/running-the-game#Traps){.print-only}**poison needle trap**{.screen-only} when a PC attempts to unlock it . When the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 inches straight out from the lock. A creature within range takes 1 piercing damage and 11 ([2D10](/roll/2d10){.screen-only}**2D10**{.print-only}) poison damage, and must succeed on a **DC 15 Constitution saving throw** or be poisoned for 1 hour. A successful **DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation)** check allows a character to deduce the trap’s presence from alterations made to the lock to accommodate the needle. A successful **DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools** disarms the trap, removing the needle from the lock. Unsuccessfully attempting to pick the lock triggers the trap. The trapped chest contains a good deal of gold coins, ([5D20+50](/roll/5d20+50){.screen-only}**5D20+50**{.print-only}) to be exact. It also hides a set of thief tools and a magical [+1 leather armor](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/armor-1){.print-only}**+1 leather armor**{.screen-only}.

The other thing of note is that the northeast passageway features a very long blood trail and deep fingernail scratch marks can be found on the ground, as if one were trying to hold on.

There is an old ratty journal on the floor here, and in it is what looks like a page out of a sage’s tome, a page folded and stuck in pages.

> You may have heard the tale of the Harvester, that occult monster feeding on the souls of our townsfolk. That is terrible enough, but the consequence of a harvested corpse is also the stuff of nightmares. Necromancers will tell you that once a harvester has killed and fed on a soul, within twenty-four hours the remains of such victim’s body---often cut in half with the harvester’s scythe---rise to ‘instinctively’ find its soul. The living attracts the soul seeker, who endlessly mistakes any living soul as its own. It attacks with unnatural claws suddenly sprouting from its fingertips, attempting to rip a soul from the victim’s body, not stopping until destroyed (preferably by total incineration). Still, no one is quite sure of the exact appearance of a Soul Seeker. Maybe it’s because so few live to tell about their encounter with the mindless progeny of the Harvester. Survivors capable of rational speech can’t bear to describe this soul-drained aberration of a corpse. {.paper}

## 3: Water Maze

**Read:**

> You approach an area filled with water, the tight passageways forming a natural labyrinth. The water dances and reflects everywhere on the walls. Nothing can be heard other than the steady drips of water. {.read}

![Water Maze](WaterMaze.jpg =250x){.print-center}

The water is only 1 foot deep, but the splashes can warn the Harvester of Souls about the presence of the party. However there is [50%](/roll/1d100){.screen-only}**50%**{.print-only} chance that the harvester does not react to mere movement, believing the noise is from the soul seekers found in [area 2](harvesters-lair-2-old-bandit-quarters){.print-only}[area 2](2-old-bandit-quarters){.screen-only}.

The dead end in the east wall used to serve as a latrine for the former bandits living here. It is not noteworthy aside from the foul odor.

If the party heads to the small passageway into [area 4](harvesters-lair-4-the-room-of-the-harvester-and-the-conclusion){.print-only}[area 4](4-the-room-of-the-harvester-and-the-conclusion){.screen-only}, there is [25%](/roll/1d100){.screen-only}**25%**{.print-only} chance of encountering giant bats. The bats hang from the high ceiling of the passageway, 20 to 30 feet high. If noise occurs, they wake up and attack. As a warning to the party, large amounts of guano can be found on this floor.

## 4: The Room of the Harvester & Conclusion

**Read:**

> The path ends in a room with no exit other than the party’s egress. Two bedrolls made of brown fur decorate the floor and lie next to the west wall. Between them lies a large sturdy chest. Near the entrance beside them, a large sack lies there too. Next to the opposing east wall is another similar bedroll, and next to it lays a belt pouch.
>
> At the very end of the room, on an old battered wooden chair, sits a humanoid figure, it’s skin is bluish black. It’s the Harvester of Souls, wearing a long leather coat and a leather hat, it skin wrapped in rags. In his right hand he holds a huge scythe. The weapon features a demonic skull atop the very long and large blade, a green aura emanating from its eye sockets. The moment you enter, the harvester of souls stands up, his green smoky eyes open wide with malice. It steps menacingly across the pool of blood before its feet and raises its scythe! {.read}

This area is designed as the final showdown with the harvester, but without the Demon Hunter sword, this fiend cannot be stopped. If one of the heroes sticks the monster with the Demon Hunter sword it immobilizes the Harvester. The party can actually transport the harvester that way and it will be unable to attack and its sentience is suppressed. The scythe of the harvester is an unhallowed artifact of Lilith, is a cursed weapon, and cannot be removed from the hand of its master. Trying to do so can render a PC to ashes and the scythe goes back to its master instantly (immediate nonphysical [3D6](/roll/3d6){.screen-only}**3D6**{.print-only} Necrotic damage. If ever a full party gets defeated and they drop the sword, the Harvester cannot touch that sword. It will flee to seek another lair and hope no one finds that sword.

No matter what they decide, if the party provides proof of the defeat of the harvester, then the lord mayor rewards the party with the gold promised and each PC gets **1 mile of arable land** in addition to [a riding horse](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/riding-horse){.print-only}[a riding horse](/monster/riding-horse){.screen-only}.

Of course, a banquet is thrown in their name and the locals henceforth greet the party as heroes.

The harvester’s room if searched and looted, the party finds **49 gold** in the **belt pouch** and the chest contains **silverware** worth approximately **243 gold**.
