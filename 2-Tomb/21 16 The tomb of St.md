# 16: The tomb of St. Frederick

## Player’s Info

The steel doors open and give way to a large circular room, its ceiling about 20 feet high. Near the center of the room lies what appears to be the sarcophagus of St. Frederick. 12 ornamental long swords are arranged on the floor surrounding the sarcophagus. The swords float up into the air and begin to spin and weave with blurring speed as you approach the body of St. Frederick.

## GM Info

This is the sarcophagus of St. Frederick. In it can be found the bones of the paladin, along with his legendary holy sword “Demon Hunter”. The sarcophagus also contains a magical set of elven chain armor (+1 AC; SRD5, p. 220). To open the sarcophagus, a successful Strength check is required (vs Medium-15), unless the party come up with a better solution.

The animated swords act as guardians. However, they do not move out of their circle. They attack viciously anything that crosses them. Treat it exactly as a permanent Blade Barrier (6th level evocation). A creature may attempt Dexterity saving throw to avoid some of the blades, or take 6d10 slashing damage. But even on a successful save, one suffers half as much damage.

The only other way (and the better way) to stop the whirling blades is by saying the sentence “Mighty St. Frederick please show us the way!” A clue is found on the note in area 11. When the words are spoken, the swords drop to the floor and won’t trigger for another 24 hours. Once the floor they cannot be picked up (just as difficult as lifting Thor’s hammer or retrieve Excalibur from the stone).

Once the party has the sword they can finally go hunting the Harvester of Souls. If the party decides to leave with the sword and never return, then not only will they become outlaws and have a bounty on their head, but the Harvester of Souls will actually hunt them down too simply for taking the weapon it fears.
