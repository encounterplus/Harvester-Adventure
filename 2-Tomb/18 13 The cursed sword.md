13: The cursed sword

Player’s Info

As you get near what appears to be a small room, the area is filled with moss, strange large mushrooms, and other humid vegetation. In the northeast corner of the room there is a pool which has formed, and in it you notice a human skeleton, a gleaming silver sword encrusted with gemstones impaled into its torso.

GM Info

This room was once used for meditation purposes, but long ago it degenerated into a mushroom heaven because of rain water seeping in from the cracked bricks of a bad foundation.

The mushrooms are toxic, emitting an invisible and slowly deliberating gas, but nothing happens immediately. If the party spends more than 10 rounds in this room, the toxin will sicken them for about 1 day. Under such condition, all physical activities are at a -1 to ability rolls (including attacks). The water from the moon fountain in are

4 can cure this poison instantly.

The sword found in the skeleton is cursed. Once taken by the handle it curses its user. The moment a battle begins, the user gets the urge to use it. At first the greatsword seems like a well-balanced magical weapon, esoteric in terms of arcane lore, and it provides +1 to both harm and initiative. This great sword’s name is known as “Master Slayer”, which is a name known to Baltasar the Sage. If the wielder rolls a 1 on any die, then he suffers disadvantage, and the sword animates with possibly lethal consequence, cleaving into its wielder with an attack roll (using the wielder’s own attack bonuses!) instead of the opponent, unless stopped by a Strength check (vs. 15), to prevent it from jumping out of one’s hands. It drops to the ground after that single strike.

Despite this rather severe disadvantage, the user of the sword will never want to get rid of it, blaming it’s animated attacks on some paranoid theory. However, the wielder gets a difficult Wisdom check vs 15 break free of the curse every time he is slashed. Only then may the user can finally drop the accursed weapon.
