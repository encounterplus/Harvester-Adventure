7: Spider tunnel

Player’s Info

This corridor goes south, then terminates turns to the left (west). It’s difficult to determine any details around the corner due to the huge thick spider webs covering the entire small corridor. There seems to be a medium sized tunnel formed out of thick webs. The area is crawling with thousands of various little spiders.

GM Info

There are hundreds of spiders of all kind every 5 feet. Most are not dangerous, but a PC with a spider phobia must succeed with a Wisdom check (vs. Hard-20), or else be incapable of going near that corridor.

What’s unique about these webs is that they are permeated with water drops, making them completely impervious to fire, and the webs themselves are super resistant to cutting. The best way to get rid of them is not by cutting the webs but by rolling the webs around a long object. It works with weapons but then the weapons become so glued and sticky by the webs that they become useless.

A staff is the best weapon/tool to get rid of the webs by this method. One staff, or other pole-arm like weapons, can grab enough webs to clear the passage for 25 feet, otherwise any smaller weapon can roll the webs away for about 5 to 10 feet each (the GM may allow one of the fallen explorers laying in the halls to possess a journal with such a hint concerning the spider corridor).

If a PC is foolish enough to try and pass through the web-filled corridor without removing them first, then he will become entangled so badly that he will fall, or hang in the webs and become completely enwrapped, stuck and paralyzed by them (Strength Check versus 15 to break free before going too deep). Regardless of how the party handles the webs, the moment the teardrop spider from area 8 feels vibration it charges in to kill (SRD5, p. 379).

Challenge 1 (200 XP)

Fire Immunity. The spider cannot be harmed by normal fire (magical fire will harm).

Spider Climb. The spider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

Web Sense. While in contact with a web, the spider knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

Web Walker. The spider ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

Actions

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.

Hit: 7 (1d8+3) piercing damage. The target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.

Web (Recharge 5-6). Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 30 ft./60 ft., one creature.

Hit: The target is restrained by webbing. As an action, the restrained target can make a DC 15 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 20; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).

If the passage is cleared, leading halfway to area 8, large spider eggs can be seen, and a lot of small treasure can be found from the cocoons of victims, as well as in the webs themselves. How the small treasure items are spread in the cocoons or in the webs is up to the GM. Some loot may be impossibly stuck causing a dangerous delay in action.
