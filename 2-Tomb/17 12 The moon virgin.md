# 12: The moon virgin

## Player’s Info

The corridor seems to turn west however you are not sure how far it goes.

## GM Info

At the end of the corridor is found the statue of the moon virgin holding a silver bowl with designs of the moon. Just like area 8, this bowl is one of the important treasures used to help open the tomb of St. Frederick. Finding this treasure provides the party with 4 CPs.

Moon bowl: Filling this bowl with the water from the moon fountain in area 4 activates it’s magic and enchants the water. The hence enchanted water must be dropped on its respective tile in area 15. When the water flows into tiny cracks of the tile, they lower the tile down which then opens and reveals the key hole (for one of the two keys found and given by the gargoyle statues). However, after about 1 hour the magical bowl vanishes from wherever it is, returning magically to the hands of the sun virgin.
