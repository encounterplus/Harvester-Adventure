9: Skull crawler’s lair

Player’s Info

This room stinks with the smell of blood and rot. It is difficult to determine what this room was used for.

Against the north wall, lies a small stone table which features pots filled with old herbs, now completely dry.

Next to the east wall lies a 20 foot long stone bench.

Against the west wall there is a stone armoire.

In the south wall a stone door stands slightly ajar, just like the one in the north wall.

Scattered all over the floor are the remains of bones, flesh and blood. Some blood splatters can be seen on some walls too. The stench is unbearable.

GM Info

The purpose of this room is to be used by worshipers. The herbs filled in ceramic bowls from the north table were used as perfume by rubbing them against the skin, but now they are dried up and worthless. The stone closet still holds some ceremonial robes, 1D4 of them at least. The satin robes are white and decorated with small golden hem, and are approximately worth 50 gold. A large steel shield with a Templar crest is also stored in the closet, and although a bit battered, is still in good condition.

The gear of the adventurers killed and eaten here have long been digested by the Skull Crawler, although a Tiara of Seduction can be found submerged in the blood pool. This magical item provides a bonus of +2 to Charisma and is worth approximately 500 gold (rare).

If the Skull Crawler isn’t hunting for vermin, the PCs will notice the creature chewing on some fleshy and bloody bones. It doesn’t notice the heroes if they simply state they’re being quiet, but if they make a noise it instantly attacks the first party member it spots.
