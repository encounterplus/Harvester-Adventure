# 5: Twin stairs hall

## GM Info: If the party come from area 2 read the following:

At the end of this wide corridor you notice two passage ways leading north, and one smaller passageway leading south. The southern way is through an open portal into another corridor. Other than those details the area looks empty of unusual details.

## GM Info:

 If the party come form area 9 read the following:

> From the doorway you noticed that the wide corridor ends and splits into twin passages, each featuring staircases which climb about 10 feet high. The west stairs lead into a small room or corridor, while the east stairs lead into a wider area. {.read}

## The Stone Door

The stone door leading into area 9 is slightly ajar. If the party pays attention, and if coming from area 2, it can hear the skull crawler feeding on the remains of former adventurers (assuming the creature is not wandering the crypt). Regardless if the skull crawler is in its lair or not a foul smell of rotting flesh and blood wafts out of that door. If the skull crawler is out hunting for vermin (75% chance that it is!) then thereâ€™s nothing to be heard.

In front of that door, up the north the corridor, splits into two passages, each featuring stairways going up leading to area 14. The left passageway once hid a falling brick trap triggered by the floor tile right under it, but the trap got broken a long time ago and the brick is now hanging halfway out, but firmly stuck in position. Pulling the brick out requires a successful Strength check (vs. Easy-10; see rules on Strength and pulling things in Core Rules). Success means the brick gets loose free and falls, creating a loud rumbling sound, filling the area with a lot of dust and dirt. The sound has 25% chance to attract a random encounter.
