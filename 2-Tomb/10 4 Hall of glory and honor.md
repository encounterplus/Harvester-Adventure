4: Hall of glory and honor

Player’s Info

The corridor features a huge stone tapestry on the west wall. It depicts scene wherein St. Frederick leads an army of knights in a clash against an army of barbarians. The area also features two steel doors without handles, located in the east wall, and a small 5 feet wide exit found to the southeast.

GM Info

The tapestry’s scenery is glorious in nature, the sun rays shining on St. Frederick’ image. Far to the right of the tapestry there is a hint of a full moon rising. A PC studying the stone tapestry’s meaning with a successful Intelligence-History check (vs. Easy-10) can identify that the battle lasted from sunrise until just after sunset. The sun and the moon represent Lord Sol versus the Evil of Satan and were probably important symbols for St. Frederick.

Facing the tapestry are two plain steel doors, however they can only be unlocked by the levers found in area 3 using the right combination. Refer to area 3 for more info about the doors and the combination. If the party succeeds in opening the doors they’ll find a fountain behind each of them. One fountain represents the moon and the other represents the sun.

The basins are enchanted with magical waters. Drinking the moon water cures any poison, and drinking the sun water heals as a 3rd level cure wounds spell once per day (2D8). Drinking more provides no benefit until the next sunrise.

However, the real purpose of the waters is to be placed in magical bowls upon the moon and sun tiles facing the double doors of St. Fredericks tomb. This is done to open area 16. The waters can only be carried in the enchanted bowls, which are found held by the moon and sun virgins respectively, otherwise the waters evaporate instantly.

The moon virgin and her moon bowl is found in area 12, while the sun virgin and her sun bowl is found in area 4
