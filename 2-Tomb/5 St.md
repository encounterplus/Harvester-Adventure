GM Info

Random encounter table of the crypt of St. Frederick

The GM can use this table to spice up the exploration if the session becomes too calm or monotonous. However these encounters should be used wisely due to the challenging predetermined encounters and traps of the crypt.

One thing to note is that the crawler creature isn’t so random in the sense that it is existent in the crypt but tends to move from corridor to corridor, it hunts vermin found in the area. Although immune to poison it prefers to avoid the lair of the tear drop spider.
