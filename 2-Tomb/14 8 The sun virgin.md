8: The sun virgin

Player’s Info

This area appears to be a giant spider nest. However, the opening north of the end of the corridor displays a statue of a beautiful young woman, a golden bowl with the emblem of the sun rests in her sculpted hands. Her fair countenance is juxtaposed by imagines of death, a pile of humanoid skulls lying at her feet among the thick webs.

GM Info

Under the pile of skulls is hidden a valuable treasure for the party, a Dagger of Venom (see SRD5 p. 215)

However, the most important treasure found in this area is the golden sun bowl held by the sun virgin to help open the tomb of St. Frederick. Finding this treasure provides the party with 100 bonus XP points.

Sun bowl: Filling this bowl with the water from the sun fountain in area 4 activates it’s magic and enchants the water. The hence enchanted water must be dropped on its respective tile in area 15. When the water flows into tiny cracks of the tile, they lower the tile down which then opens and reveals the key hole (for one of the two keys found and given by the gargoyle statues). However, after about 1 hour the magical bowl vanishes from wherever it is, returning magically to the hands of the sun virgin.
