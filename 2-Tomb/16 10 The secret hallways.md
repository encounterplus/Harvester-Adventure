10: The secret hallways

GM Info: If the party come from area

2 read the following:

This tight corridor follows a staircase ascending 10 feet, turning left westward after 35’, and, after another 5 feet ahead, turning to the east.

GM Info: If the party come form area

14 read the following:

Just beyond the secret passage, the tight corridor ends after 15’.

The passage then turns left, toward the south, leading into the dark beyond your light source.

Then, facing south, you see a corridor turning right, 5’ from where you stand, toward the west.

GM Info

The area is devoid of any particular details other than the staircase south. However if the party comes from area

2, then the northeast dead end terminates with the secret passage leading to area

14 (Refer to it for the details about finding the secret passageway.)

11: Little note corridor

Player’s Info

At about 50 feet, the tight, east to west corridor has has another passage heading south. At your feet you notice a piece of parchment. The area smells and feels really moist.

GM Info

If a PC picks up the parchment, although the ink has smudged everywhere on it one can still read the following clearly...

“There is no way in hell that we can find this sword, we have tried everything! This place is filled with traps and terrifying creatures I’ve never seen before. Its puzzles are impossible. It is madness, and I doubt the sword even exists. St. Frederick must simply be a myth. I’m done and I quit! I leave this behind to others whom have been sent on a fool’s errand to find this legendary sword. I think it’s a Psarmorum scheme to kill off treasure hunters! But if you do persist let me tell you this, the levers found in the room near the entrance are impossible to work with. There are too many possibilities and we lost many of our party members because of them. The ones not so far from the gargoyles spit fire, roasting anybody triggering them if the combination is wrong. I never found the answer, for fear worse things would be triggered. We’ve lost too many as it was.

We found a silver moon bowl held by the statue of a virgin, but we didn’t knew what to do with it. It must have been cursed because after some time, the bowl always ended up back in the hands of the accursed virgin statue! Gilbert thinks the fresco has something to tell or do with the floor slabs found in front of the steel doors near the gargoyle area. Sorry that’s all I can do to help, good luck, you’ll need it. I need to report what little I’ve found to Baltasar the Sage. I tell you this, if you do this for gold you are fools, your lives are much more precious than stupid coins! If you intend to go on, here is a riddle for you: read the prayer opposite to stop the blades of bad fortune” signed Sabrina the Fox.

On the back of the note is a very important writing which says... “Mighty St. Frederick please show us the way!” If this sentence is said in area

16, it will stop the animated swords.

Other than the note, there is nothing special about this area.
