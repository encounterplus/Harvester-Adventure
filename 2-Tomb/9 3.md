3.) As one might guess, the dead adventurers lying on the floor all have been poisoned by the triggered trap.

LOOT:

A human arcanist wearing a green hooded robe and simple leather shoes carries 1 belt pouch with 31 gold and 5 silver. He also has 1 scroll case with 2 spells of firebolt (cantrip).

A human warrior sporting a chain shirt, red trousers, soft leather boots, and chain mail armor. He also carries a backpack filled with 1D6 torches, 1 flint and steel, 7 dry rations, a 25 feet hemp rope, and 1 bedroll. The bedroll is wrapped around 1 potion of healing. The man was also armed with a short sword, which is sheathed. 1 belt pouch is also found and contains 24 gold, 13 silver and 37 copper.

The other adventurer who dropped to the floor a bit further south is an elf wearing colorful leather armor, colorful trousers, and colorful high but soft leather boots (elves, colorful even in death!). He carries a footman’s mace. Also tied to his belt is a flute case holding an elaborate wooden flute worth approximately 35 gold due to its quality. Inside his trousers the elf hid 1 belt pouch which contains a copper ring with a sculpted unicorn head, worth approximately 20 gold. The pouch also contains 11 gold, 67 silver, 3 copper and 1 love letter that says “My love my husband is away until the end of the week, please meet with me behind the temple.”
