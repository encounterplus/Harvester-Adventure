# 2: Hall of Welcoming

## Player’s Info

In the middle of this hall you see a large basin filled with murky water to which is affixed a placard engraved with writing. Walls are built from very large and heavy stone bricks. The stone bricks glisten with moisture and are covered with cobwebs. The hall splits into many corridors to the south and east.

## GM Info

This corridor features many openings. A stone floor tile is equivalent to 5 feet as shown on the map. Just like the stairs area, the ceiling is about 10 feet high, and the corridor’s dimensions changes with certain areas. Walls are built from very large and heavy stone bricks. The rest of the crypt follows the same pattern and description for ceiling, walls, and floors, unless otherwise stated.

The core center area of the corridor features a large basin facing the exit stairs, a plaque on it reads:

“Wash Thy Sinful Hands All Whom Dare Enter Here, Else Decay Forever in the Irons you’ve Wrought, in the name of Lord Sol”

The basin is now appearing unhallowed, filled as it is with filthy water.

The purpose of the plaque is to discourage superstitious people from exploring further. The clergy of Psarmorum are sure to emphasize that no one is devoid of imperfection. The filthy water is not blessed and has no other purpose whatsoever.

To keep the basin filled and to keep the illusion that it fills itself miraculously by its own, a cleric occasionally comes to fill the basin with nearby spring water.

In the south direction there are two corridors, one which leads to area 3 and one which leads to area 3 contains two cut slit shapes from floor to ceiling each facing to each other and which hide sliding steel doors that only close if the trap in area

3 contains two cut slit shapes from floor to ceiling each facing to each other and which hide sliding steel doors that only close if the trap in area 3 is triggered.

About 15 to 20 feet east of the basin is a secret passage that only a PC actively searching may discover with a successful Wisdom (Perception) check (vs. Medium-15). The secret doorway is triggered by pushing a brick in the ceiling just over it, and the passage leads to area 10.

Near the secret passage in the corner, part of the wall has collapsed and filled the floor with rubble. In the debris there is an aggressive and semi-sentient magical construct; a Bull Brick monster, acting as a guardian. It charges if triggered (See below) if a party member gets 5 feet near it.

Psarmorum is a land of strange inconsistencies. For one, the Templars tend to fear and distrust magic. But those in power understand demon blood fuels their people’s success and power in keeping the chaos of the unsettled lands from overwhelming them. As such there exists an uncomfortable acceptance of some forms of magic. The glamour of the shee, absolutely anathema, but the deviously lethal contraptions of a Psarmorum Arcanist, that is another matter. In fact, the priesthood encourages the Arcanists who act as curators for the Walk of the Ages in Temple Mount (the Templar Knights’ official hall of history and historical artifacts) to construct defensive measures. Euphemistically known in Psarmorum as the Curators. These magic users fulfil a demand for guardians for places of secluded sacredness around the realm. It’s not just places like the Walk of Ages or Seervall Cathedral that holy relics may be stolen, nor is Temple Mount the only place where these golems and constructs of the Curators are encountered, to the great detriment of would-be thieves.

One such creature mimics a large, solitary brick in the wall, created by the Curator Briquemort. It’s a guardian designed to chase cultists away from the sword of Saint Frederick. Hapless thieves rarely notice the construct turned facing the wall with large iron spikes protruding into the shadows. When the mimicking construct detects intruders getting too close, it raises from the ground on it’s odd, human legs (always the repurposed legs and feet of heretics), swiveling around to charge impossibly fast, impaling intruders with its spikes (see Bull Brick, above).
