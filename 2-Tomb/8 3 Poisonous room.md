3: Poisonous room

Player’s Info

The first things your party notices in this room are 8 steel-like lids occupying the floor in the center of the room. There’s some rust on them but otherwise they look like they are in good condition. However, there are the corpses of 3 adventurers lying around them, two of them holding their necks in rigamortus. The room also features 4 small sections which feature steel levers which appear to be in a reset position.

GM Info

The levers (Which are numbered at their bases!) when pulled in the right combination open the locked stone doors of area 4 to reveal the moon and sun fountains. Not all the levers are visible from every vantage point, so it may help to sketch out the map for the players.

The right combination and order is 146 (the year the paladin dispatched the Harvester). The players must be cautious because if the levers are pulled in the wrong order, the sliding steel doors found in area 2 instantly close. This happens lightning fast, triggering the steel floor lids to open and shoot out corrosive, poisonous green vapors that fills the entire room.

The poison is lethal deals 1D4 damage each round for 1D4+2 hours unless the target makes a Constitution Saving Throw versus 15. It’s nearly impossible not to breath the fumes even when putting a cloth over the mouth. The steel doors are so thick that they were meant to be indestructible.

If the party successfully finds the right combination, a loud mechanical noise can be heard from area

2, and especially area 4 since the steel doors get unlocked. However, the party has only 12 rounds to use the fountains found in area 4, because after that time has passed the levers reset to their original position, causing the doors to close and lock themselves.

It’s also theoretically possible perish from suffocation if stuck behind one of the steel doors when standing in area 4 if nobody can activate the levers with the right combination. This is because the steel doors are so thick that they are practically indestructible and form a perfect seal.

It’s up to the GM to decide if the doors can actually be destroyed or not, but keep in mind that the traps were meant to be deadly, otherwise someone would have succeeded in looting the place long ago.

(Order of levers is 1 and 2 found in the northwest section, 3 and 4 found in the southwest section, 4 and 6 found in the northeast section, and 7 and 8 found in the southeast section of area
