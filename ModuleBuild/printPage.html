<p>An Eldritch revised edition adventure module written by Eric Bergeron and edited by Dan Hill Cross. Designed for four 2nd Level Characters.</p>
<p>Ainer&#xEA;ve is the official setting of the Eldritch Role-Playing game, published by Crossroads Games and available through DrivethruRPG, though this version of the adventure is for use with the Fifth Edition of the world&#x2019;s most popular fantasy role-playing game.</p>

<p>Ainer&#xEA;ve is a dream world, a shadow realm, an alternative dimension. It coexists undetectably with the Earth that we all know so well. Its essence may be primordial chaos, raw protomatter left over from the creation of the universe, or perhaps the aether of the ancients: the fifth element, breathed by the gods and forming the soul. Whatever its basis, its substance is mainly shaped by thought and takes local form from the beliefs and imaginings of humankind. Ainer&#xEA;ve is thus something like a phantom Earth &#x2014; it has lands and seas, mountains and rivers, sun and moon &#x2014; but reality there is unstable, and areas of normality are set like mosaic pieces in a changeable flux of dream and caprice.</p>
<p>This adventure takes place in a small fisherman settlement called Poisson, which sits on the north shore of a lake known as Lac Noir (Black Lake). The town is small but important in Psarmorum, renowned for the quality of its fish trade as well as its abundant crops and fertile soil. Recently, despair crept into the hearts of the people of Poisson, caused by a horror as deep and dark as the lake itself. The town&#x2019;s prosperity is threatened by the deaths and disappearances of its people along the outskirts of town, most of them farmers.</p>
<p>At first the relatives of the many victims imagined the attacks came from goblin incursions from the northern ghost marsh, which is not uncommon. However, that theory fell once they discovered some victims&#x2019; mutilated bodies. There was a palpable evil about the corpses. Clearly something darker, something more foul, was afoot. No, most realized this wasn&#x2019;t the doing of goblins. The lord mayor of Poisson, Marcel Laberge, was quite alarmed, but attempted to avoid panic among the townsfolk. The town is one of peace, boasting only a small contingent of guards. These town guards were ill equipped to deal with supernatural evil. Marcel decided to send some couriers out to seek Members of the Homers Guild, brave folk who he knew could can get rid of the problem for him. Most importantly, this could be done without the involvement of the Psarmorum priests and witch hunters, who often made things much worse for the common folk.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s where the adventuring comes in&#x2026;</p>

<p>The Harvester of Souls Adventure</p>
<p>This is an adventure from Crossroads Games, originally written for the Eldritch RPG by Eric Bergeron. It has been converted to 5E
and turned into a module for Encounter+. I finished the module in Encounter+ and didn&#x2019;t realize I couldn&#x2019;t export back out into a format allowing editing in Studio Code, so the markdown files in the repository are being redone right now. Ironically, the .module file is the most recent version.</p>
</div><div class="footer-background"></div><div class="footer-content">README.md | Harvester</div><div class="footer-page-number">3</div></div><a id="group-1-camp"></a><a id="3-camp-sitemd"></a><div class="print-page"><div class="page-content two-column"><h1 id="camp-site"><a id="3-camp-sitemd-camp-site"></a>CAMP SITE</h1>
<p>Your adventure begins in an encampment, surrounded by three large tents spread out over a gently sloping grassy mound. Your group stands near the largest and most luxurious tent, taking in the sights and sounds. You&#x2019;re grateful to be guests awaiting a quick bite of roasted pig after your recent travels. The delicious smells filling your nostrils nearly distract from thinking of your mission, which will be far less pleasant than the meal you&#x2019;re about to enjoy. The guards and nobler men in fancy outfits all stand about with worried expressions, despite the festivities, and this refreshes your memory instantly.</p>
<p>You hadn&#x2019;t been heading toward this place, but realized you had an opportunity for riches after coming across a written plea for help nailed to an old wooden post along the road. The parchment offered a reward of 2500 gold to hunt down and destroy a monster.</p>
<p><img src="1-Camp\Images\HoS_Camp_first_person.png" alt="Players Map"></p>
<p><strong>As adventurers, monster hunting is not typically the most lucrative of pursuits, but this was an unusually high reward. The post provided the location of an imminent meeting at a camp set up by Lord Marcel Laberge as a temporary outpost.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Due to bad weather, you arrived by night, a bit late to for the expected convening of local soldiers. You were met with some suspicion by men at arms, but after some questioning, were led to Lord Marcel Laberge himself. He told you only mercenaries had answered their plea for help. &#x201C;You must be the only ones who&#x2019;d call yourselves heroes around here. But even heroes need rest, so I&#x2019;ll provide more details in the morning,&#x201D; Lord Laberge had said.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You shared a tent with a bunch of mercenaries who didn&#x2019;t sleep as well as you all did. None of you were known by name, despite recent escapades, but your confidence is likely much greater than the nervous looking men-for- hire around you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>So now late morning has come, and you&#x2019;re awaiting further direction.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Some mercenaries stand guard at the perimeter, but most are milling about, discussing games and bragging about exploits over breakfast. That&#x2019;s why you&#x2019;re unable to make out what&#x2019;s being said between Lord Laberge and one who appears to be a merchant. Their expressions are dire, but you can&#x2019;t quite make out what they are saying due to the general din of conversation. Their voices are carried off in different directions by the cool morning breeze.</strong></p>
<p><u>GM Info</u></p>
<p>The mercenaries were more nervous at night because that is when the monster is most likely to strike, and so far, nobody has lived through an encounter.</p>
<p class="paper">GM&#x2019;s Note: Pause between paragraphs of speech. Players invariably interrupt canned speech to speak. Mix and match the spoken words to natural flow of conversation, or simply paraphrase.</p>
<ul>
<li>Read Aloud:</li>
</ul>
<div class="blockquote-read-wrap"><blockquote class="read">
<p>The nobleman and merchant see you, and move their conversation toward your party. Turns out the merchant is affiliated with The Guardians&#x2019; Guild, a large, powerful guild of mercenaries and explorers. You catch on that the discussion is related to selling goods at a discount to adventurers. The lord greets you:
&#x201C;Welcome, I hope you slept well and had a tasty breakfast. Although we met briefly yesterday, allow me to introduce myself more properly. I am Lord Mayor Marcel Laberge, a former knight. I could have retired, living the rest of my days wealthy, but I must oversee the townsfolk of Poisson. They are my people and they are in danger.</p>
</blockquote>
</div><p>After a pause (or answering questions) he continues&#x2026;</p>
<div class="blockquote-read-wrap"><blockquote class="read">
<p>I am terribly sorry the accommodations are makeshift, inadequate for those of either renown or infamy. However, this secluded camp serves a purpose. This matter is to be kept from common folk&#x2019;s ears. We must avoid general panic leading to chaos. We are faced with a new and serious threat. Many serfs and farmers of my land have gone missing, or have been killed, and now the killings are getting closer and closer to Poisson. It&#x2019;s normally goblin hordes from the southern borders causing problems, but the horrors we&#x2019;ve seen speak of demonic activity. The demonic fiend known as the &#x201C;Harvester of Souls&#x201D; now roams the land and it must be dealt with haste for fear that it gains back its full strength and power becoming stronger and stronger as time goes by.</p>

The Order of Chaplains serves all Psarmorum. All ordained priests, from the Bishop of the city of the Temple Mount on down, are initiated members of the order.</p>
<div class="blockquote-read-wrap"><blockquote class="read">
<p>&#x201C;I offer reward for those who travel to the crypt and find the sword within, then hunt down and slay the harvester in its lair, with all due haste. Fortunately, local rangers tracked down the fiend and discovered its lair where it rests and regenerates during its daytime slumber. Only one ranger made it back alive to report its whereabouts, so we know it can be awakened during the day, even if in a weakened state. Two adventuring parties before you answered our plea. However, quite regretfully, not even one member has returned. Will you be the victorious party? Are you heroic enough to fetch the sword and slay the fiend? If so great riches and fresh arable land await you! If not, we pray to Sol that someone will have the guts to save us all!&#x201D;</p>
</blockquote>
</div><p><u>GM Info</u></p>
<p>The player characters will certainly ask questions or require more info during the knight&#x2019;s soliloquy.</p>
<p><strong>Questions about the fiend and its victims</strong>: The lord mayor knows more than he&#x2019;s willing to say, but won&#x2019;t reveal why the fiend is free because he doesn&#x2019;t know how that happened. But what he can say is that the &#x201C;Harvester of Souls&#x201D; name comes from the fact that when this fiend kills it steals the soul of its victim. Sometimes such victim comes back as a terrifying undead creature which tries to find a soul back. He also says that victims are often cut in two with just one hit. Over 60 years ago, when he was a young boy, he vividly remembers something about cultists summoning this fiend to find immortality and some cultist relatives might still exist today and may still be loyal to the &#x201C;Harvester of Souls&#x201D;.</p>
<div class="blockquote-read-wrap"><blockquote class="read">
<p>Don&#x2019;t be fooled by the nature of this quest, this is no ordinary monster hunt. This fiend cannot be killed by normal means. In fact, it cannot be killed at all. It can only be stopped, and only one weapon can do that. I am referring to the sword of St. Frederick, a weapon blessed by archangel Dumah. The blade was wielded by the late paladin Frederick Lachance who once defeated the Harvester.&#x201D; &#x201C;Unfortunately, to protect the relic from the old cult of the &#x2018;Harvester of Souls&#x2019;, those who summoned the fiend you must now stop, the The Order of Chaplains hid St. Frederick&#x2019;s holy weapon well. Nobody has been successful in an attempt to retrieve the sword. The crypt where it is hidden is filled with traps. Its wards have stopped many would be thieves, treasure hunters, and most importantly, the cultists who&#x2019;d seek to control the very being they pretend to worship. We are the founding members of Chevaliers de la Chauve-Souris, and so we know where the crypt lies. However, we have no idea how one is to find the sword. Being that the harvester has returned, I can only hope the sword is still there, for all our  sakes.&#x201D;</p>

<div class="blockquote-read-wrap"><blockquote class="read">
<p>The crypt is topped by an honorary statue in the image of the paladin St. Frederick. It was ordered to be built by The Order of Chaplains. The location of the crypt is indicated on a map that the lord mayor provides. The map was drawn by a ranger who goes by the name of Robert Lafontaine, one well known locally for his cartography skills, and luckily, one of the few to survive reconnaissance around the Harvester&#x2019;s lair. As mentioned, the crypt itself is filled with traps to avoid would be thieves or cultists to steal the holy sword and desecrate St. Frederick&#x2019;s remains. However, the crypt was also built for his loyal followers all of whom disappeared long ago. There may be some clerics who occasionally check the crypt for signs of intrusion, but their involvement with the place is minimal. Sadly, we didn&#x2019;t find meaningful records in the temple&#x2019;s archives to find a safe way to recover the sword. Neither could the local clerics inform us of things we didn&#x2019;t already know. But we know the builders allowed for some safe paths to take, and it&#x2019;s my understanding there are clues to access certain areas of the crypt. This I&#x2019;m told is especially true of the inner sanctum, the main tomb area. It&#x2019;s not impossible for experts such as yourselves to retrieve the sword.</p>
</blockquote>
</div><p><strong>Questions about the Harvester of Souls Lair</strong>:</p>
<div class="blockquote-read-wrap"><blockquote class="read">
<p>The rangers that first discovered the lair thought that the wide cave mouth lead to the hideout of a small party of bandits. However, the stench coming out of the cave was unbearable, a smell of death and decay. The rangers did not venture into it, but confirmed the active traces of the Harvester of Souls.</p>
</blockquote>
</div><p>More questions about the Harvester of Souls itself:</p>
<div class="blockquote-read-wrap"><blockquote class="read">
<p>The description of the Harvester of Souls come from some cultists&#x2019; books that old knights recovered during an inquisition. It is said that the fiend was once a human. However how it became a fiend was kept as a secret (see GMs section below for more information) but it is now described as a human like figure with dark blueish-black skin, wrapped in tattered, shredded clothes. Some say it occasionally dresses like a simple farmer. It is also known that it wields a powerful weapon rumored to suck out the life force of its victims.</p>
</blockquote>
</div><p>To Neutralize the Harvester: The sword must be used to immobilize the Harvester. The local sage has knowledge of the whereabouts of a runic coffin where the Harvester can be placed. Once the monster is in the coffin the sword may be removed and the lid closed. This prevents its reanimation. That coffin can be transported to the priesthood where they&#x2019;re most powerful can destroy it. If anybody other than the order of chaplains attempts to take the sword, it will anger the priesthood, probably triggering a visit from justicars. Returning the sword to the chaplains may be a side quest if others in town are intent on stealing or keeping it for themselves.</p>

<p><u>GM Info</u></p>
<p>The camp features three core tents, one is for the mercenaries on watch, another for the travelling merchant (which also houses his personal mercenary contingent) and the last, fanciest one is for the Lord mayor and his personal bodyguards.</p>
<p><strong>Mercenary tent</strong>: This tent features 8 bedrolls, each next a medium size wooden chest containing most of the gear the mercenaries need. The chests are nearly full when the mercenaries are resting. There is 50% chance for any chest to contain 1D4 rolls of bandages with 1D4 wine bottles. The tent also features one medium sized crate which contains 5D20 dry rations and 1D6 + 4 water skins. Some of the bedrolls and chests are always empty, set up for any PC who comes to the camp and needs a place to store their possessions.</p>
<p><strong>Merchant Tent</strong>: This tent features six bedrolls, each with a small wooden chest next to it. The merchant&#x2019;s mercenaries keep their gear in these chests when resting. During rest, the chests should contain the exact same sort of gear the soldier tent features (see NPC stats for specifics). The merchant&#x2019;s bedroll is filled with valuable fur from the north, therefore his bedroll has a value of 1D10 + 50 gold. The tent also contains various crates containing his entire merchandise list (Refer to the merchant store for more details!) and a locked chest in which he keeps the steel key around his neck. The chest contains 1000 + 1D1000 gold, a journal which keeps tracks of the merchandise, and another journal which shows the safest roads to take for travel. There&#x2019;s also a very pretty silver tiara with a Jade gemstone encrusted in the middle. The tiara is worth 1D4 X 100 gold. The tiara has no special meaning; however, the GM can certainly create a quick background story as to why the merchant is holding onto this valuable piece of jewelry.</p>
<p><strong>Mayor Tent</strong>: This tent contains 6 bedrolls for the Lord mayor&#x2019;s bodyguards, and one luxurious cot for the lord mayor lined with fine northern fur. Just like the other tents, the lord mayor&#x2019;s bodyguards each own chests which they store gear during rest. The gear is the same as the mercenaries&#x2019; other than the crossbows, which are replaced with longbows, and the bolts which are replaced by arrows. The lord mayor&#x2019;s cot and fur are worth 3D20 + 50 gold. The Lord mayor has a small, steel chest which is locked by a key he keeps in his belt pouch. The chest only contains a bottle of fine southern wine, and a letter from his daughter which reads&#x2026; &#x201C;May you be blessed be. Come back home safely. Signed&#x2026; Rosalie.&#x201D; The Lord mayor keeps all his true valuables on his person.</p>
<p>Stealing any content from any of the tents is possible, however it would prove quite difficult. The mercenaries and watchmen keep a good eye on any outsiders.</p>

<p>The merchant was summoned by the lord mayor to re-supply a party even though the mayor himself provides some free supply (gear worth 25 gold that the party may choose from the merchant&#x2019;s list), the merchant is there for extra but as the party closes in they can hear the merchant arguing about not giving away too much to the party or else he won&#x2019;t make a dime and he will have to leave immediately.</p>
<p>Merchant Supplies: Jean-Luc can provide the party some supplies from this list. The GM may assume he can sell standard weaponry as well.</p>

It&#x2019;s mixed with a heavy dose of troll and ogre fat, and said to treat fever quickly. It only requires a check of Wisdom versus DC 10 for the balm to take effect, which does so under about 30 mins.

<p>Potentia Leaf (NEW Item!, Wondrous Item, Uncommon): This is a three-headed, long green and red leaf. It&#x2019;s the size of a palm, found from a flower growing exclusively in the Ghost Marsh. The correct application of this leaf requires a healing check against a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, because the leaf must be chewed into a thick paste, but never swallowed, else one will quickly find the leaf highly toxic. The paste must be instantly applied on open wounds or burns, and if done right the leafy green putty heals 2d4+2 HP. The healing of this miraculous plant takes effect immediately, almost instantly sealing a wound, and stopping any bleeding or oozing. However due to its toxicity, failing the healing check means the balm may harm the patient and deal 1D4 HP of damage! Luckily, an easy (vs. 10) Constitution check can prevent the HP loss (though it still feels like a burn).</p>

<p>The PCs are informed of their quest, fully outfitted, and have some inkling of what they are to do. The mercenaries of the camp continue to patrol the surrounding environs, their primary mission to protect the simple farmers and fishermen of the village. Lord Laberge escort the heroes to the edge of the camp and bid them farewell and Godspeed, but before the PCs are able to travel far, there are screams heard from the forest in every direction!</p>
<div class="blockquote-read-wrap"><blockquote class="read">
<p>Eight men burst from the trees, and at first it looks as if they are charging at you, but no, you quickly realize, they are charging straight at some sinister humanoid form. The monster stands about 50 paces from where you look, silhouetted against the sun, half hidden by foliage. The men rip open dark, tattered lavender tunics as they run toward this being, exposing their bare chests. They yell out, &#x201C;Harvest Me O Lord&#x201D; and are quickly approaching the creature as you react. Any of the men who reach the monster are quickly shredded into bloody bits, blood spraying so ridiculously high that it almost seems like a sideshow at a macabre circus. These are the cultists, who believe to be murdered by the Harvester means eternal life. They are dead wrong, but only in a way. Sure enough, these men will reform to fight the PCs. </p>

</div><p>And here is the Harvester, pure hate and drive, unthinking, uncaring about these worshiping fleshbags. Whatever, it think in its limited capacity, kill and kill alike. But the Harvester, for all the fear that it may inspire___and as impossible as it may be to kill___is still in a weakened state and will not full_out attack the adventuring party. It will retreat after converting some of the cultists to undead battle slaves.</p>
<p>If the PCs get too close to the Harvester before he&#x2019;s ready to entirely reveal itself, he will &#x201C;kill&#x201D; himself, throwing himself down upon his own scythe, exploding into a cloud of dry inkiness and then dissolving into wispy smoke shredded by the breeze (along with the scythe itself). This method of departure should be unnerving to say the least, and is precisely the sort of tactic that inspired some of the cultists in the first place&#x2026;</p>

<p>The corridor features a huge stone tapestry on the west wall. It depicts scene wherein St. Frederick leads an army of knights in a clash against an army of barbarians. The area also features two steel doors without handles, located in the east wall, and a small 5 feet wide exit found to the southeast.</p>
<p><img src="2-Tomb\Images%5CTapestry.png" alt="Tapestry" width="300"></p>
<h2 id="gm-info"><a id="10-4-hall-of-glory-and-honormd-gm-info"></a>GM Info</h2>
<p>The tapestry&#x2019;s scenery is glorious in nature, the sun rays shining on St. Frederick&#x2019; image. Far to the right of the tapestry there is a hint of a full moon rising. A PC studying the stone tapestry&#x2019;s meaning with a successful Intelligence-History check (vs. Easy-10) can identify that the battle lasted from sunrise until just after sunset. The sun and the moon represent Lord Sol versus the Evil of Satan and were probably important symbols for St. Frederick.</p>
<p>Facing the tapestry are two plain steel doors, however they can only be unlocked by the levers found in area 3 using the right combination. Refer to area 3 for more info about the doors and the combination. If the party succeeds in opening the doors they&#x2019;ll find a fountain behind each of them. One fountain represents the moon and the other represents the sun.</p>
<p>The basins are enchanted with magical waters. Drinking the moon water cures any poison, and drinking the sun water heals as a 3rd level cure wounds spell once per day (2D8). Drinking more provides no benefit until the next sunrise.</p>
<p>However, the real purpose of the waters is to be placed in magical bowls upon the moon and sun tiles facing the double doors of St. Fredericks tomb. This is done to open area 16. The waters can only be carried in the enchanted bowls, which are found held by the moon and sun virgins respectively, otherwise the waters evaporate instantly.</p>
<p>The moon virgin and her moon bowl is found in area 12, while the sun virgin and her sun bowl is found in area 4.</p>

<p>The stone door leading into area 9 is slightly ajar. If the party pays attention, and if coming from area 2, it can hear the skull crawler feeding on the remains of former adventurers (assuming the creature is not wandering the crypt). Regardless if the skull crawler is in its lair or not a foul smell of rotting flesh and blood wafts out of that door. If the skull crawler is out hunting for vermin (75% chance that it is!) then there&#x2019;s nothing to be heard.</p>
<p>In front of that door, up the north the corridor, splits into two passages, each featuring stairways going up leading to area 14. The left passageway once hid a falling brick trap triggered by the floor tile right under it, but the trap got broken a long time ago and the brick is now hanging halfway out, but firmly stuck in position. Pulling the brick out requires a successful Strength check (vs. Easy-10; see rules on Strength and pulling things in Core Rules). Success means the brick gets loose free and falls, creating a loud rumbling sound, filling the area with a lot of dust and dirt. The sound has 25% chance to attract a random encounter.</p>

<p>This corridor goes south, then terminates turns to the left (west). It&#x2019;s difficult to determine any details around the corner due to the huge thick spider webs covering the entire small corridor. There seems to be a medium sized tunnel formed out of thick webs. The area is crawling with thousands of various little spiders.</p>
<p><img src="2-Tomb\Images%5CHoS_CoSF_Play_webs_and_skulls.png" alt="Spiderwebs"></p>
<h2 id="gm-info"><a id="13-7-spider-tunnelmd-gm-info"></a>GM Info</h2>
<p>There are hundreds of spiders of all kind every 5 feet. Most are not dangerous, but a PC with a spider phobia must succeed with a Wisdom check (vs. Hard-20), or else be incapable of going near that corridor.</p>
<p>What&#x2019;s unique about these webs is that they are permeated with water drops, making them completely impervious to fire, and the webs themselves are super resistant to cutting. The best way to get rid of them is not by cutting the webs but by rolling the webs around a long object. It works with weapons but then the weapons become so glued and sticky by the webs that they become useless.</p>
<p>A staff is the best weapon/tool to get rid of the webs by this method. One staff, or other pole-arm like weapons, can grab enough webs to clear the passage for 25 feet, otherwise any smaller weapon can roll the webs away for about 5 to 10 feet each (the GM may allow one of the fallen explorers laying in the halls to possess a journal with such a hint concerning the spider corridor).</p>
<p>If a PC is foolish enough to try and pass through the web-filled corridor without removing them first, then he will become entangled so badly that he will fall, or hang in the webs and become completely enwrapped, stuck and paralyzed by them (Strength Check versus 15 to break free before going too deep). Regardless of how the party handles the webs, the moment the teardrop spider from area 8 feels vibration it charges in to kill (SRD5, p. 379).</p>

<p>This area appears to be a giant spider nest. However, the opening north of the end of the corridor displays a statue of a beautiful young woman, a golden bowl with the emblem of the sun rests in her sculpted hands. Her fair countenance is juxtaposed by imagines of death, a pile of humanoid skulls lying at her feet among the thick webs.</p>
<h2 id="gm-info"><a id="14-8-the-sun-virginmd-gm-info"></a>GM Info</h2>
<p>Under the pile of skulls is hidden a valuable treasure for the party, a Dagger of Venom (see SRD5 p. 215).</p>
<p>However, the most important treasure found in this area is the golden sun bowl held by the sun virgin to help open the tomb of St. Frederick. Finding this treasure provides the party with 100 bonus XP points.</p>
<p>Sun bowl: Filling this bowl with the water from the sun fountain in area 4 activates it&#x2019;s magic and enchants the water. The hence enchanted water must be dropped on its respective tile in area 15. When the water flows into tiny cracks of the tile, they lower the tile down which then opens and reveals the key hole (for one of the two keys found and given by the gargoyle statues).

<p>&#x201C;There is no way in hell that we can find this sword, we have tried everything! This place is filled with traps and terrifying creatures I&#x2019;ve never seen before. Its puzzles are impossible. It is madness, and I doubt the sword even exists. St. Frederick must simply be a myth. I&#x2019;m done and I quit! I leave this behind to others whom have been sent on a fool&#x2019;s errand to find this legendary sword. I think it&#x2019;s a Psarmorum scheme to kill off treasure hunters! But if you do persist let me tell you this, the levers found in the room near the entrance are impossible to work with. There are too many possibilities and we lost many of our party members because of them. The ones not so far from the gargoyles spit fire, roasting anybody triggering them if the combination is wrong. I never found the answer, for fear worse things would be triggered. We&#x2019;ve lost too many as it was. We found a silver moon bowl held by the statue of a virgin, but we didn&#x2019;t knew what to do with it. It must have been cursed because after some time, the bowl always ended up back in the hands of the accursed virgin statue! Gilbert thinks the fresco has something to tell or do with the floor slabs found in front of the steel doors near the gargoyle area. Sorry that&#x2019;s all I can do to help, good luck, you&#x2019;ll need it. I need to report what little I&#x2019;ve found to Baltasar the Sage. I tell you this, if you do this for gold you are fools, your lives are much more precious than stupid coins! If you intend to go on, here is a riddle for you: read the prayer opposite to stop the blades of bad fortune&#x201D; signed Sabrina the Fox.</p>

<h2 id="gm-info"><a id="17-12-the-moon-virginmd-gm-info"></a>GM Info</h2>
<p>At the end of the corridor is found the statue of the moon virgin holding a silver bowl with designs of the moon. Just like area 8, this bowl is one of the important treasures used to help open the tomb of St. Frederick. Finding this treasure provides the party with 4 CPs.</p>
<p>Moon bowl: Filling this bowl with the water from the moon fountain in area 4 activates it&#x2019;s magic and enchants the water. The hence enchanted water must be dropped on its respective tile in area 15. When the water flows into tiny cracks of the tile, they lower the tile down which then opens and reveals the key hole (for one of the two keys found and given by the gargoyle statues). However, after about 1 hour the magical bowl vanishes from wherever it is, returning magically to the hands of the sun virgin.</p>

<p>As you get near what appears to be a small room, the area is filled with moss, strange large mushrooms, and other humid vegetation. In the northeast corner of the room there is a pool which has formed, and in it you notice a human skeleton, a gleaming silver sword encrusted with gemstones impaled into its torso.</p>
<p><img src="2-Tomb\Images%5CSkeleton_and_mushrooms.png" alt="Adventurer on floor"></p>
<h2 id="gm-info"><a id="18-13-the-cursed-swordmd-gm-info"></a>GM Info</h2>
<p>This room was once used for meditation purposes, but long ago it degenerated into a mushroom heaven because of rain water seeping in from the cracked bricks of a bad foundation.</p>
<p>The mushrooms are toxic, emitting an invisible and slowly deliberating gas, but nothing happens immediately. If the party spends more than 10 rounds in this room, the toxin will sicken them for about 1 day. Under such condition, all physical activities are at a -1 to ability rolls (including attacks). The water from the moon fountain in are 4 can cure this poison instantly.</p>
<p>The sword found in the skeleton is cursed. Once taken by the handle it curses its user. The moment a battle begins, the user gets the urge to use it. At first the greatsword seems like a well-balanced magical weapon, esoteric in terms of arcane lore, and it provides +1 to both harm and initiative. This great sword&#x2019;s name is known as &#x201C;Master Slayer&#x201D;, which is a name known to Baltasar the Sage. If the wielder rolls a 1 on any die, then he suffers disadvantage, and the sword animates with possibly lethal consequence, cleaving into its wielder with an attack roll (using the wielder&#x2019;s own attack bonuses!) instead of the opponent, unless stopped by a Strength check (vs. 15), to prevent it from jumping out of one&#x2019;s hands. It drops to the ground after that single strike.</p>
<p>Despite this rather severe disadvantage, the user of the sword will never want to get rid of it, blaming it&#x2019;s animated attacks on some paranoid theory. However, the wielder gets a difficult Wisdom check vs 15 break free of the curse every time he is slashed. Only then may the user can finally drop the accursed weapon.</p>

</div><h2 id="gm-info"><a id="19-14-the-halls-of-the-guardiansmd-gm-info"></a>GM Info</h2>
<p>This area features many things.</p>
<p>The gargoyles, although life-like, are just statues, but their mouths clearly display a hole that the party will notice instantly. The gargoyles&#x2019; function can be triggered by the numbered levers found in the far northern area. If the right combination is used then each gargoyle spits a key from the hole in its mouth. One of keys is made of silver, and the other is made of gold, but the keys are otherwise unremarkable. These keys are to be used for the moon and sun tiles found in area 15. The lever combination is 123 (the equivalent of the medieval idiot&#x2019;s luggage code!), and is etched into the underside of the desk in area However with a wrong combination the lever&#x2019;s handles all spew fire, which deals 3D6 damage.</p>
<p><img src="2-Tomb\Images%5CHoS_CoSF_Play_Gargoyle.png" alt="Gargoyles"></p>
<p>The altar stands under chandeliers found in the northeast section, and was once used for prayers to Sol. A dusty prayer book sits on the alter. The prayers once told the right combination for the area&#x2019;s levers, however the paper of the tome pages have all rotten and the tome is now useless (except by some improvised restorative or psychogenic power). One adventurer etched the proper combination into the underside of the altar, which turned out to be 123, a number with no religious significance whatsoever, which was likely by design. The chandeliers are made of silver and each are worth approximately 75 gold each.</p>
<p>The west corridor area is is very damaged, with cracks everywhere, but the area actually looks worse than it is. The party can actually use that passage safely, while only the floor fissure can prove hazardous. It shouldn&#x2019;t cause any problems for a careful PC which wants to cross it (unless something terrible arises from out of the fissure! Roll against random encounter table).</p>

<p>These double steel doors open the room of St. Frederick&#x2019;s tomb area. The party must first use the key of the gargoyles found in area 14 to activate the moon and sun tiles before these doors will open. Doing so will unlock and push the tiles deeper into the ground.</p>
<p>That said, an expert thief with thief tools can unlock them (DC 25). However, once the tiles have been pushed deeper into the ground, the party must pour the enchanted water onto the tiles using the moon and sun bowls. If this is done correctly, the water will fill each tile and the double steel doors open for a full hour, until everything resets.</p>
<p>If all is done right, the party can finally proceed into the tomb area.</p>

<p>The steel doors open and give way to a large circular room, its ceiling about 20 feet high. Near the center of the room lies what appears to be the sarcophagus of St. Frederick. 12 ornamental long swords are arranged on the floor surrounding the sarcophagus. The swords float up into the air and begin to spin and weave with blurring speed as you approach the body of St. Frederick.</p>
<h2 id="gm-info"><a id="21-16-the-tomb-of-stmd-gm-info"></a>GM Info</h2>
<p>This is the sarcophagus of St. Frederick. In it can be found the bones of the paladin, along with his legendary holy sword &#x201C;Demon Hunter&#x201D;. The sarcophagus also contains a magical set of elven chain armor (+1 AC; SRD5, p. 220). To open the sarcophagus, a successful Strength check is required (vs Medium-15), unless the party come up with a better solution.</p>
<p><img src="2-Tomb\Images%5CHoS_CoSF_Play_sarcophagus.png" alt="Sarcophagus"></p>
<p>The animated swords act as guardians. However, they do not move out of their circle. They attack viciously anything that crosses them. Treat it exactly as a permanent Blade Barrier (6th level evocation). A creature may attempt Dexterity saving throw to avoid some of the blades, or take 6d10 slashing damage. But even on a successful save, one suffers half as much damage.</p>
<p>The only other way (and the better way) to stop the whirling blades is by saying the sentence &#x201C;Mighty St. Frederick please show us the way!&#x201D; A clue is found on the note in area 11. When the words are spoken, the swords drop to the floor and won&#x2019;t trigger for another 24 hours. Once the floor they cannot be picked up (just as difficult as lifting Thor&#x2019;s hammer or retrieve Excalibur from the stone).</p>
<p>Once the party has the sword they can finally go hunting the Harvester of Souls. If the party decides to leave with the sword and never return, then not only will they become outlaws and have a bounty on their head, but the Harvester of Souls will actually hunt them down too simply for taking the weapon it fears.</p>

<p>Unless the party has a means of seeing in the dark, the area is pitch black. The ceiling is approximately 10 feet high, the steps about 10 feet wide and about 20 feet long, but the staircase is 40 feet high so the steps are steep.</p>
<p>The ceiling and the walls are made of large stone bricks, however the stairs appear roughhewn, sculpted boulder.</p>
<p>There is a lot of dirt on the steps, tracked in by animals who&#x2019;ve had direct access to the outside world. The only noises to be heard are the outside winds and the faint sounds of rippling water coming from the basin in the Hall of Welcoming.</p>

<p>In the middle of this hall you see a large basin filled with murky water to which is affixed a placard engraved with writing. Walls are built from very large and heavy stone bricks. The stone bricks glisten with moisture and are covered with cobwebs. The hall splits into many corridors to the south and east.</p>
<p><img src="2-Tomb\Images\Water_Basin.png" alt="Water Basin" width="400"></p>
<h2 id="gm-info"><a id="7-2-hall-of-welcomingmd-gm-info"></a>GM Info</h2>
<p>This corridor features many openings. A stone floor tile is equivalent to 5 feet as shown on the map. Just like the stairs area, the ceiling is about 10 feet high, and the corridor&#x2019;s dimensions changes with certain areas. Walls are built from very large and heavy stone bricks. The rest of the crypt follows the same pattern and description for ceiling, walls, and floors, unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p>The core center area of the corridor features a large basin facing the exit stairs, a plaque on it reads:</p>
<p>&#x201C;Wash Thy Sinful Hands All Whom Dare Enter Here, Else Decay Forever in the Irons you&#x2019;ve Wrought, in the name of Lord Sol&#x201D;</p>
<p>The basin is now appearing unhallowed, filled as it is with filthy water.</p>
<p>The purpose of the plaque is to discourage superstitious people from exploring further. The clergy of Psarmorum are sure to emphasize that no one is devoid of imperfection. The filthy water is not blessed and has no other purpose whatsoever.</p>
<p>To keep the basin filled and to keep the illusion that it fills itself miraculously by its own, a cleric occasionally comes to fill the basin with nearby spring water.</p>
<p>In the south direction there are two corridors, one which leads to area 3 and one which leads to area 3 contains two cut slit shapes from floor to ceiling each facing to each other and which hide sliding steel doors that only close if the trap in area 3 contains two cut slit shapes from floor to ceiling each facing to each other and which hide sliding steel doors that only close if the trap in area 3 is triggered.</p>
<p>About 15 to 20 feet east of the basin is a secret passage that only a PC actively searching may discover with a successful Wisdom (Perception) check (vs. Medium-15). The secret doorway is triggered by pushing a brick in the ceiling just over it, and the passage leads to area 10.</p>
<p>Near the secret passage in the corner, part of the wall has collapsed and filled the floor with rubble. In the debris there is an aggressive and semi-sentient magical construct; a Bull Brick monster, acting as a guardian. It charges if triggered (See below) if a party member gets 5 feet near it.</p>

<p>Psarmorum is a land of strange inconsistencies. For one, the Templars tend to fear and distrust magic. But those in power understand demon blood fuels their people&#x2019;s success and power in keeping the chaos of the unsettled lands from overwhelming them. As such there exists an uncomfortable acceptance of some forms of magic. The glamour of the shee, absolutely anathema, but the deviously lethal contraptions of a Psarmorum Arcanist, that is another matter. In fact, the priesthood encourages the Arcanists who act as curators for the Walk of the Ages in Temple Mount (the Templar Knights&#x2019; official hall of history and historical artifacts) to construct defensive measures. Euphemistically known in Psarmorum as the Curators. These magic users fulfil a demand for guardians for places of secluded sacredness around the realm. It&#x2019;s not just places like the Walk of Ages or Seervall Cathedral that holy relics may be stolen, nor is Temple Mount the only place where these golems and constructs of the Curators are encountered, to the great detriment of would-be thieves.</p>
<p>One such creature mimics a large, solitary brick in the wall, created by the Curator Briquemort. It&#x2019;s a guardian designed to chase cultists away from the sword of Saint Frederick. Hapless thieves rarely notice the construct turned facing the wall with large iron spikes protruding into the shadows. When the mimicking construct detects intruders getting too close, it raises from the ground on it&#x2019;s odd, human legs (always the repurposed legs and feet of heretics), swiveling around to charge impossibly fast, impaling intruders with its spikes (see Bull Brick, above).</p>

<p>The first things your party notices in this room are 8 steel-like lids occupying the floor in the center of the room. There&#x2019;s some rust on them but otherwise they look like they are in good condition. However, there are the corpses of 3 adventurers lying around them, two of them holding their necks in rigamortus. The room also features 4 small sections which feature steel levers which appear to be in a reset position.</p>
<p><img src="2-Tomb\Images%5CPoison_Room.png" alt="Poison Room"></p>
<h2 id="gm-info"><a id="8-3-poisonous-roommd-gm-info"></a>GM Info</h2>
<p>The levers (Which are numbered at their bases!) when pulled in the right combination open the locked stone doors of area 4 to reveal the moon and sun fountains. Not all the levers are visible from every vantage point, so it may help to sketch out the map for the players.</p>
<p>The right combination and order is 146 (the year the paladin dispatched the Harvester). The players must be cautious because if the levers are pulled in the wrong order, the sliding steel doors found in area 2 instantly close. This happens lightning fast, triggering the steel floor lids to open and shoot out corrosive, poisonous green vapors that fills the entire room.</p>
<p>The poison is lethal deals 1D4 damage each round for 1D4+2 hours unless the target makes a Constitution Saving Throw versus 15. It&#x2019;s nearly impossible not to breath the fumes even when putting a cloth over the mouth. The steel doors are so thick that they were meant to be indestructible.</p>
<p>If the party successfully finds the right combination, a loud mechanical noise can be heard from area 2, and especially area 4 since the steel doors get unlocked. However, the party has only 12 rounds to use the fountains found in area 4, because after that time has passed the levers reset to their original position, causing the doors to close and lock themselves.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s also theoretically possible perish from suffocation if stuck behind one of the steel doors when standing in area 4 if nobody can activate the levers with the right combination. This is because the steel doors are so thick that they are practically indestructible and form a perfect seal.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s up to the GM to decide if the doors can actually be destroyed or not, but keep in mind that the traps were meant to be deadly, otherwise someone would have succeeded in looting the place long ago.</p>
<p>(Order of levers is 1 and 2 found in the northwest section, 3 and 4 found in the southwest section, 4 and 6 found in the northeast section, and 7 and 8 found in the southeast section of area 3.) As one might guess, the dead adventurers lying on the floor all have been poisoned by the triggered trap.</p>

<p>The other adventurer who dropped to the floor a bit further south is an elf wearing colorful leather armor, colorful trousers, and colorful high but soft leather boots (elves, colorful even in death!). He carries a footman&#x2019;s mace. Also tied to his belt is a flute case holding an elaborate wooden flute worth approximately 35 gold due to its quality. Inside his trousers the elf hid 1 belt pouch which contains a copper ring with a sculpted unicorn head, worth approximately 20 gold. The pouch also contains 11 gold, 67 silver, 3 copper and 1 love letter that says &#x201C;My love my husband is away until the end of the week, please meet with me behind the temple.&#x201D;</p>

<p><img src="3-Cave\Images%5CHoS_HL_GM_Map1a.png" alt="Caves"></p>
<h1 id="1%3A-cave-entrance"><a id="1-harvesters-lairmd-1-cave-entrance"></a>1: Cave Entrance</h1>
<h2 id="player%E2%80%99s-info"><a id="1-harvesters-lairmd-players-info"></a>Player&#x2019;s Info</h2>
<p>You approach a cave as indicated by your map. The wide entrance set in a rocky overgrown hillside looks deep and dark without any sign of life. Before the entrance, on each side of a lone boulder, dance two trees by the wind&#x2019;s music; that&#x2019;s the only sound you can hear. Indeed, the area is eerily quiet.</p>
<h2 id="gm-info"><a id="1-harvesters-lairmd-gm-info"></a>GM Info</h2>
<p>As the party gets near the entrance they can smell rot and will notice black flies flying and buzzing all over the place.</p>
<h2 id="2%3A-old-bandit-quarters"><a id="1-harvesters-lairmd-2-old-bandit-quarters"></a>2: Old bandit quarters</h2>
<h3 id="player%E2%80%99s-info-2"><a id="1-harvesters-lairmd-players-info"></a>Player&#x2019;s Info</h3>
<p>The wide cave here is big, between 50 and 80 feet in certain sections, featuring many exits and ceilings as high as 20 feet. The floor is speckled with fresh blood, attracting swarms of flies. The place looks like some people lived here. There is crude furniture around, such as a round wooden table, some wooden stools, and some wooden shelves hanging on uneven walls. On one of the shelves sits a small chest and some fur. Many ceramic or steel bowls, pots and utensils sit on makeshift wooden tables. Some crates are found deeper north along with a bag and a chest. On the far east side, there seems to be a camp fire still burning. To the west side, near two exits can be found a bedroll made of brown fur.</p>
<h3 id="gm-info-2"><a id="1-harvesters-lairmd-gm-info"></a>GM Info</h3>
<p>The gore covering the walls emits an unbearable stench of death. Two Soul Seeker Monsters reside here, and if the party isn&#x2019;t quiet, they immediately charge at them, flailing and contorting their bodies in a macabre way. The soul seekers only wear rags or nothing at all.</p>
<p>If the party can search and loot the area, pretty much everything is rotten or broken, and the only thing of interest are two chests; one on the northern shelf, and the bigger chest on the ground between crates farther north. The small unlocked chest contains 7 simple copper rings worth approximately 10 gold each. A blue gemstone worth approximately 35 gold can be found in a fake bottom. A larger chest can trigger a poison needle trap when a PC attempt to unlock it (SRD5, p. 198) . When the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 inches straight out from the lock. A creature within range takes 1 piercing damage and 11 (2d10) poison damage, and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check allows a character to deduce the trap&#x2019;s presence from alterations made to the lock to accommodate the needle. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves&#x2019; tools disarms the trap, removing the needle from the lock. Unsuccessfully attempting to pick the lock triggers the trap (System Reference Document 5.1 Copyright 2016, Wizards of the Coast, Inc). The trapped chest contains a good deal of gold coins, 5D20+50 to be exact. It also hides a set of thief tools and a magical +1 leather armor.</p>
<p>The other thing of note is that the northeast passageway features a very long blood trail and deep fingernail scratch marks can be found on the ground, as if one were trying to hold on.</p>
<p>There is an old ratty journal on the floor here, and in it is what looks like a page out of a sage&#x2019;s tome, a page folded and stuck in pages.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You may have heard the tale of the Harvester, that occult monster feeding on the souls of our townsfolk. That is terrible enough, but the consequence of a harvested corpse is also the stuff of nightmares. Necromancers will tell you that once a harvester has killed and fed on a soul, within twenty-four hours the remains of such victim&#x2019;s body&#x2014;often cut in half with the harvester&#x2019;s scythe&#x2014;rise to &#x2018;instinctively&#x2019; find its soul. The living attracts the soul seeker, who endlessly mistakes any living soul as its own. It attacks with unnatural claws suddenly sprouting from its fingertips, attempting to rip a soul from the victim&#x2019;s body, not stopping until destroyed (preferably by total incineration). Still, no one is quite sure of the exact appearance of a Soul Seeker. Maybe it&#x2019;s because so few live to tell about their encounter with the mindless progeny of the Harvester. Survivors capable of rational speech can&#x2019;t bear to describe this soul-drained aberration of a corpse&#x201D;.</p>

<p>You approach an area filled with water, the tight passageways forming a natural labyrinth. The water dances and reflects everywhere on the walls. Nothing can be heard other than the steady drips of water.</p>
<h3 id="gm-info"><a id="23-3-water-mazemd-gm-info"></a>GM Info</h3>
<p>The water is only 1 foot deep, but the splashes can warn the Harvester of Souls about the presence of the party. However there is 50% chance that the harvester does not react to mere movement, believing the noise is from the soul seekers found in area 2.</p>
<p>The dead end in the east wall used to serve as a latrine for the former bandits living here. It is not noteworthy aside from the foul odor.</p>
<p>If the party heads to the small passageway in area
4, there is 25% chance of encountering giant bats. The bats hang from the high ceiling of the passageway, 20 to 30 feet high. If noise occurs, they wake up and attack. As a warning to the party, large amounts of guano can be found on this floor.</p>

<p>The path ends in a room with no exit other than the party&#x2019;s egress. Two bedrolls made of brown fur decorate the floor and lie next to the west wall. Between them lies a large sturdy chest. Near the entrance beside them, a large sack lies there too. Next to the opposing east wall is another similar bedroll, and next to it lays a belt pouch.</p>
<p>At the very end of the room, on an old battered wooden chair, sits a humanoid figure, it&#x2019;s skin is bluish black. It&#x2019;s the Harvester of Souls, wearing a long leather coat and a leather hat, it skin wrapped in rags. In his right hand he holds a huge scythe. The weapon features a demonic skull atop the very long and large blade, a green aura emanating from its eye sockets. The moment you enter, the harvester of souls stands up, his green smoky eyes open wide with malice. It steps menacingly across the pool of blood before its feet and raises its scythe!</p>
