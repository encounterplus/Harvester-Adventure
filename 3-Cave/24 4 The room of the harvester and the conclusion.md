# 4: The room of the harvester and the conclusion

### Player’s Info

The path ends in a room with no exit other than the party’s egress. Two bedrolls made of brown fur decorate the floor and lie next to the west wall. Between them lies a large sturdy chest. Near the entrance beside them, a large sack lies there too. Next to the opposing east wall is another similar bedroll, and next to it lays a belt pouch.

At the very end of the room, on an old battered wooden chair, sits a humanoid figure, it’s skin is bluish black. It’s the Harvester of Souls, wearing a long leather coat and a leather hat, it skin wrapped in rags. In his right hand he holds a huge scythe. The weapon features a demonic skull atop the very long and large blade, a green aura emanating from its eye sockets. The moment you enter, the harvester of souls stands up, his green smoky eyes open wide with malice. It steps menacingly across the pool of blood before its feet and raises its scythe!
