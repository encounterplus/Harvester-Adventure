GM Info

This area is designed as the final showdown with the harvester, but without the Demon Hunter sword, this fiend cannot be stopped. If one of the heroes sticks the monster with the Demon Hunter sword it immobilizes the Harvester. The party can actually transport the harvester that way and it will be unable to attack and its sentience is suppressed. The scythe of the harvester is an unhallowed artifact of Lilith, is a cursed weapon, and cannot be removed from the hand of its master. Trying to do so can render a PC to ashes and the scythe goes back to its master instantly (immediate nonphysical 3D6 Necrotic damage. If ever a full party gets defeated and they drop the sword, the Harvester cannot touch that sword. It will flee to seek another lair and hope no one finds that sword.

No matter what they decide, if the party provides proof of the defeat of the harvester, then the lord mayor rewards the party with the gold promised and each PC gets 1 mile of arable land in addition to a riding horse.

Of course, a banquet is thrown in their name and the locals henceforth greet the party as heroes.

The harvester’s room if searched and looted, the party finds 49 gold in the belt pouch and the chest contains silverware worth approximately 243 gold.

Regeneration. The Harvester regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn (sunlight or running water has no effect on this). If the Harvester takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn’t function at the start of the vampire’s next turn.

Misty Escape: When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist instead of falling Unconscious, (regardless of sunlight or running water). If it can’t transform, it is destroyed. While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can’t revert to its humanoid form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its humanoid form at full hitpoints! If it rests anywhere outside of its lair, then is then Paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.

Weaknesses. The Harvester has the following flaws:

Sword (specific) to the Heart. The Harvester is destroyed if a specific legendary weapon is driven into its heart while it is incapacitated in its resting place.
