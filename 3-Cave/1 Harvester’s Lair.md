**Harvester’s Lair** {.text-center}

# 1: Cave Entrance

## Player’s Info

You approach a cave as indicated by your map. The wide entrance set in a rocky overgrown hillside looks deep and dark without any sign of life. Before the entrance, on each side of a lone boulder, dance two trees by the wind’s music; that’s the only sound you can hear. Indeed, the area is eerily quiet.

## GM Info

As the party gets near the entrance they can smell rot and will notice black flies flying and buzzing all over the place.

## 2: Old bandit quarters

### Player’s Info

The wide cave here is big, between 50 and 80 feet in certain sections, featuring many exits and ceilings as high as 20 feet. The floor is speckled with fresh blood, attracting swarms of flies. The place looks like some people lived here. There is crude furniture around, such as a round wooden table, some wooden stools, and some wooden shelves hanging on uneven walls. On one of the shelves sits a small chest and some fur. Many ceramic or steel bowls, pots and utensils sit on makeshift wooden tables. Some crates are found deeper north along with a bag and a chest. On the far east side, there seems to be a camp fire still burning. To the west side, near two exits can be found a bedroll made of brown fur.

### GM Info

The gore covering the walls emits an unbearable stench of death. Two Soul Seeker Monsters reside here, and if the party isn’t quiet, they immediately charge at them, flailing and contorting their bodies in a macabre way. The soul seekers only wear rags or nothing at all.

If the party can search and loot the area, pretty much everything is rotten or broken, and the only thing of interest are two chests; one on the northern shelf, and the bigger chest on the ground between crates farther north. The small unlocked chest contains 7 simple copper rings worth approximately 10 gold each. A blue gemstone worth approximately 35 gold can be found in a fake bottom. A larger chest can trigger a poison needle trap when a PC attempt to unlock it (SRD5, p. 198) . When the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 inches straight out from the lock. A creature within range takes 1 piercing damage and 11 (2d10) poison damage, and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check allows a character to deduce the trap’s presence from alterations made to the lock to accommodate the needle. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disarms the trap, removing the needle from the lock. Unsuccessfully attempting to pick the lock triggers the trap (System Reference Document 5.1 Copyright 2016, Wizards of the Coast, Inc). The trapped chest contains a good deal of gold coins, 5D20+50 to be exact. It also hides a set of thief tools and a magical +1 leather armor.

The other thing of note is that the northeast passageway features a very long blood trail and deep fingernail scratch marks can be found on the ground, as if one were trying to hold on.

There is an old ratty journal on the floor here, and in it is what looks like a page out of a sage’s tome, a page folded and stuck in pages.

“You may have heard the tale of the Harvester, that occult monster feeding on the souls of our townsfolk. That is terrible enough, but the consequence of a harvested corpse is also the stuff of nightmares. Necromancers will tell you that once a harvester has killed and fed on a soul, within twenty-four hours the remains of such victim’s body---often cut in half with the harvester’s scythe---rise to ‘instinctively’ find its soul. The living attracts the soul seeker, who endlessly mistakes any living soul as its own. It attacks with unnatural claws suddenly sprouting from its fingertips, attempting to rip a soul from the victim’s body, not stopping until destroyed (preferably by total incineration). Still, no one is quite sure of the exact appearance of a Soul Seeker. Maybe it’s because so few live to tell about their encounter with the mindless progeny of the Harvester. Survivors capable of rational speech can’t bear to describe this soul-drained aberration of a corpse”.
