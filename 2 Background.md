# Background:

Ainerêve is a dream world, a shadow realm, an alternative dimension. It coexists undetectably with the Earth that we all know so well. Its essence may be primordial chaos, raw protomatter left over from the creation of the universe, or perhaps the aether of the ancients: the fifth element, breathed by the gods and forming the soul. Whatever its basis, its substance is mainly shaped by thought and takes local form from the beliefs and imaginings of humankind. Ainerêve is thus something like a phantom Earth --- it has lands and seas, mountains and rivers, sun and moon --- but reality there is unstable, and areas of normality are set like mosaic pieces in a changeable flux of dream and caprice.

This adventure takes place in a small fisherman settlement called Poisson, which sits on the north shore of a lake known as Lac Noir (Black Lake). The town is small but important in Psarmorum, renowned for the quality of its fish trade as well as its abundant crops and fertile soil. Recently, despair crept into the hearts of the people of Poisson, caused by a horror as deep and dark as the lake itself. The town’s prosperity is threatened by the deaths and disappearances of its people along the outskirts of town, most of them farmers.

At first the relatives of the many victims imagined the attacks came from goblin incursions from the northern ghost marsh, which is not uncommon. However, that theory fell once they discovered some victims' mutilated bodies. There was a palpable evil about the corpses. Clearly something darker, something more foul, was afoot. No, most realized this wasn’t the doing of goblins. The lord mayor of Poisson, Marcel Laberge, was quite alarmed, but attempted to avoid panic among the townsfolk. The town is one of peace, boasting only a small contingent of guards. These town guards were ill equipped to deal with supernatural evil. Marcel decided to send some couriers out to seek Members of the Homers Guild, brave folk who he knew could can get rid of the problem for him. Most importantly, this could be done without the involvement of the Psarmorum priests and witch hunters, who often made things much worse for the common folk.

That’s where the adventuring comes in...
